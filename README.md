## Why It Interests Me
I found this article interesting because it highlights how long-context language models—with context windows extending up to millions of tokens—open new opportunities for realistic software engineering tasks.  

Unlike traditional benchmarks that only test small code snippets, LoCoBench evaluates models on entire codebases, requiring cross-file reasoning, architectural consistency, and even multi-session development.  

What stands out to me is how it pushes LLMs beyond toy problems into real-world software development challenges, which feels very relevant to how developers actually work.

## Comment by Jasmine Zhu
I really appreciate how it moves beyond evaluating LLMs on isolated code snippets and instead focuses on their performance across entire codebases. The emphasis on cross-file reasoning and architectural consistency is crucial, as this mirrors the actual challenges developers face when working with large, complex projects. It's exciting to see research that bridges the gap between AI capabilities and real world software engineering workflows. Thanks for sharing this!
