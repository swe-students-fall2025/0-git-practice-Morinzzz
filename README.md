## Why It Interests Me
I found this article interesting because it highlights how long-context language models—with context windows extending up to millions of tokens—open new opportunities for realistic software engineering tasks.  

Unlike traditional benchmarks that only test small code snippets, LoCoBench evaluates models on entire codebases, requiring cross-file reasoning, architectural consistency, and even multi-session development.  

What stands out to me is how it pushes LLMs beyond toy problems into real-world software development challenges, which feels very relevant to how developers actually work.
